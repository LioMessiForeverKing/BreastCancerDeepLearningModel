# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning and Computer Vision

This project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to predict breast cancer based on a dataset. It provides a comprehensive pipeline from data analysis to model training and deployment via a Flask web application. The solution is educational and demonstrates best practices in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and web-based deployment.

Project Highlights:
Machine Learning Model: Trains and evaluates a predictive model for breast cancer classification using a structured dataset (breast cancer.csv).
Web Application: Deploys the model with an intuitive user interface built using Flask, enabling real-time predictions.
Educational Purpose: Serves as a hands-on example of integrating Python, Jupyter, and Flask for end-to-end machine learning projects.
Key Files:
Jupyter Notebook: Includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training.
Flask App: A web interface (app.py) for input data submission and prediction rendering.
Model Artifacts: Trained machine learning models stored as serialized objects (model.pkl).
Static and Templates: HTML templates and static assets for the web application.
This project can be further enhanced by incorporating advanced deep learning models, additional datasets, or more sophisticated visualization tools.
